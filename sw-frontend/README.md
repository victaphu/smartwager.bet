# StakeWise.Bet - Chainlink Constellation Hackathon (2023)
Stake your NFT, choose your wager and use the staked NFT as collateral.  
Stakewise allow you to bridge your NFTs onto the stakewise platform, mint clamnotes and use these notes to wager against various events.  

The Stakewise platform will automatically manage the wager, results, and disbursement. Each wager is represented as a dNFT holding the 
wager details and results. The dNFT is updated using Chainlink Automation and Chainlink VRF. Future automation will use real-world events.
